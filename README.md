# peterplanner-download

PeterPlanner is a course prerequisite tracker and scheduling tool for UCI students.

This is the script that deals with downloading the entire [UCI General Catalogue](http://catalogue.uci.edu/), and [Course Prerequisites](https://www.reg.uci.edu/cob/prrqcgi), as well as the relevant terms from [WebSOC (Schedule of Classes)](https://www.reg.uci.edu/perl/WebSoc), and the `DGW_Report.xsl` file for a user from [DegreeWorks](https://www.reg.uci.edu/access/student/degreeworks/?seg=U).
